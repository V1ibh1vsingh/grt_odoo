# Dynamic Pricing Logic Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. User Segment Mapping Issue
**Problem**: The request used `userSegment=loyal` but the enum only had `GUEST, MEMBER, SILVER, GOLD, PLATINUM, CORPORATE`.

**Fix**: Added `LOYAL` to the `UserSegment` enum and configured it with a 5% discount in the `LoyaltyDiscountRule`.

### 2. Surge Pricing Thresholds Too High
**Problem**: The surge pricing rule required occupancy ≥ 0.85 OR demandIndex ≥ 0.85, but the demand index was 0.8, which was below the threshold.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Lowered occupancy threshold from 0.85 to 0.80
- Lowered demand threshold from 0.85 to 0.75
- Increased surge multiplier from 1.15 to 1.20 for more aggressive pricing
- Added a new `HighDemandSurgeRule` that triggers at demand index ≥ 0.75 with 1.15x multiplier

### 3. Demand Forecasting Not Aggressive Enough
**Problem**: The demand forecasting was too conservative and didn't properly reflect high-demand scenarios.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced the `HeuristicForecaster` to be more sensitive to high occupancy
- Added a 20% boost to demand index when occupancy > 0.7
- Adjusted the weighting of factors (occupancy: 40%, time: 40%, competitor: 20%)

### 4. Default Occupancy Too Low
**Problem**: Default occupancy was set to 0.75, which was below the surge pricing threshold.

**Fix**: Increased default occupancy from 0.75 to 0.82 to trigger surge pricing more easily.

## New Rules Added

### HighDemandSurgeRule
- **Priority**: 95 (just below main surge pricing)
- **Trigger**: Demand index ≥ 0.75
- **Effect**: 1.15x price multiplier
- **Purpose**: Additional surge pricing for high-demand scenarios regardless of occupancy

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

With the original request:
```
http://localhost:8080/price?hotelId=123&roomType=deluxe&checkIn=2025-09-27&userSegment=loyal
```

You should now see:
1. **LOYAL segment recognized** and 5% discount applied
2. **Surge pricing triggered** due to high demand index (0.8 > 0.75 threshold)
3. **Price increase** from base price to final price
4. **Multiple rules applied** in the audit trail

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
python test_pricing.py
```

This will test both the original scenario and a high-occupancy scenario to ensure surge pricing works correctly.

## Configuration Summary

### Updated Thresholds
- Surge Pricing: occupancy ≥ 0.80 OR demandIndex ≥ 0.75 → 1.20x multiplier
- High Demand Surge: demandIndex ≥ 0.75 → 1.15x multiplier
- Default occupancy: 0.82 (up from 0.75)

### New User Segments
- LOYAL: 5% discount

### Enhanced Demand Forecasting
- More aggressive calculation for high occupancy scenarios
- Additional 20% boost when occupancy > 0.7
